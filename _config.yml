# About Section

I am a curious, growing UX designer, ready to apply the power of empathy in design. 
With experiences in behavior therapy and program coordination, I always look for ways to accommodate and improve the accesibility and enjoyability of an experience. 
  
  You can even add paragraphs by using empty lines like this and add anything else markdown supports such as
